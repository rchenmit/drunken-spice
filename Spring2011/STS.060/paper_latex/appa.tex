%Appendices may appear after the paper proper.  Appendices may hold
%extra information that would interrupt the flow of the paper and that
%is not absolutely necessary for the reader to appreciate the work.
%For example, a large number of related figures or a mathematical
%derivation could go nicely in an appendix.
